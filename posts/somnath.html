<p>From Delhi, we traveled by train and then road to the western coast of Gujarat. The Somnath Temple, with its majestic architecture overlooking the Arabian Sea, was a breathtaking sight. The sound of waves and the temple bells created a serene atmosphere.</p>

<p>We learned about the temple's historical significance, surviving multiple destructions and reconstructions. Witnessing the evening arti by the sea was unforgettable. The trip gave us a deeper appreciation for faith, resilience, and Indian heritage.</p>

<p>Exploring the nearby local markets, tasting traditional Gujarati snacks, and walking along the seafront added a joyful cultural touch to our journey.</p>
